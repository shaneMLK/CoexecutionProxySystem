# CoexecutionProxySystem
Code includes a coexecution proxy server connects to a database and waits for query requests for the database from executors, analyzes the database's execution plan for sensitive data, and asks co-executioners, users that can grant access, for approval the query is trying to access secure sensitive data. GUI's are supplied for both the executor and coexecutioner.
